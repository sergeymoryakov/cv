Dear Ms. Bensky,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Business Development Manager position at QOCO Systems, as advertised on [where you found the job posting]. With a background that combines extensive experience in aviation and a recent transition into software development, I am excited to contribute my unique skill set to your dynamic and innovative team.

In my current role as a Software Developer Trainee at MORYAKOV Oy, I am actively engaged in acquiring foundational knowledge and practical skills in software development. I have completed a series of comprehensive courses, including HarvardX's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science and Front-End Development Bootcamp from SD.CODE. My GitHub portfolio showcases web applications developed using a variety of technologies.

As the Founder and Aviation Consultant at MORYAKOV Oy, I have provided consulting services to the aviation industry globally. My responsibilities have included consulting to investors, advising private firms on market strategy, conducting aircraft inspections, and delivering engine management training. These experiences have honed my skills in business development, client relations, and market research.

During my tenure as VP Sales & Customer Service at GA Telesis Engine Services Oy, I successfully led a global sales and customer service team, achieving double-digit revenue growth and managing the team's migration to a new CRM platform. My time as a Regional Sales Director at GE Aviation further strengthened my business development acumen, where I identified new opportunities and closed sales for 200+ aircraft engines and services contracts.

My unique blend of aviation industry expertise and newfound software development skills equips me to offer innovative solutions and a fresh perspective. I am confident that my ability to identify business opportunities, build and maintain client relationships, and lead successful sales teams aligns perfectly with QOCO's vision.

I am particularly drawn to QOCO's commitment to revolutionizing the aviation industry with cutting-edge software solutions and its inclusive team culture. I believe my international background and willingness to travel align well with the demands of the role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your company's goals. Please feel free to reach out to me at [Your Phone Number] or via email at [Your Email Address].

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
