Hello and thank you for visiting my LinkedIn profile!

I have a unique background that combines almost three decades in aviation with my recent venture into web development. My experience in aviation has taught me a lot about complex systems, how to provide excellent customer service, and handle technical challenges. These skills have been really helpful in my new role.

I focus on building web applications that are tailored to what my clients need. My engineering background helps me find smart and practical ways to solve problems. I believe in always learning new things, working well with others, and bringing new ideas to the table.

I'm excited to see how the mix of aviation experience and web development skills can help your project or business. Let's connect!
